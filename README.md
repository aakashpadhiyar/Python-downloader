Multithreaded File Downloader
=============================

This Python script uses multithreading to download files from the web in parallel. It splits the file into multiple parts and downloads them concurrently, then merges them into a single file.

Dependencies
------------

*   `threading`
*   `concurrent.futures`
*   `requests`

Usage
-----

To use the script, simply replace the `down_links` variable with a list of URLs to download, and the `File_name` variable with a list of desired filenames for each download. Then run the script.

pythonCopy code

```
urls = down_links

with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as executor:
    futures = []
    for url, filename in zip(urls, File_name):
        futures.append(executor.submit(download, url, filename))

    for future in as_completed(futures):
        result = future.result()
        print(result)

```python

How it works
------------

The `download()` function takes in a URL and filename, then splits the file into 30 parts and downloads each part concurrently using threads. The `download_part()` function is called by the threads to download a specific part of the file.

Once all parts are downloaded, they are merged into a single file and the part files are deleted. The `ThreadPoolExecutor` is used to handle the threads and ensure that they are cleaned up correctly.
